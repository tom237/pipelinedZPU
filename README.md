most of the core tested wisbone wait and stall state not

for memory have to use xilinx block ram with blk_mem_gen_v7_3_0 name

startup folder contain modified gcc files copy them to zpugcc toolchain/gcc/libgloss/zpu
then complie gcc
this modification is reguired if you want use priority interrupt and POPINT instruction or comment them out in zpupkg.v if don't vant to use.
in pic_example folder there is a priority interupt example

	-zpupkg.v (definitions for soc and core)

	-zpu_control (use this as top level when implement)
		-zpu_core.v (real toplevel)
			-wb_shared_bus.v
			-int_basic_perif.v
				-debug_serial.v
			-cpu_core.v
				-execution.v
				-regfetch.v
				-decode.v
				-steck.v
			-block ram with enable pins
		
zpu_tb.v is an easy testbanch to drive the soc in it have to implement trace 

zpuromgencoe is generate a .coe file from .bin for xilinx block ram generator
usage
zpuromgencoe <input file name>.bin <output file name>.coe

	TODO list:
		-trace generator
		-debug core
		-rom generator
		-wisbone test
		-SRAM ctrl and caches
